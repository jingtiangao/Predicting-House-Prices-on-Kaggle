# Predicting House Prices on Kaggle
- Built Multilayer Perceptron model and used squared loss function using Mxnet, which predict
house prices and got top 10% ranking (375th of 4422).
-  Conducted data processing using Python Pandas, which standardize the continuous numerical
values and convert discrete values into indicative features.
- Tuned Parameters, use dropout, weight decay, adam optimization algorithm,k-fold cross-validation
to reduce overfitting and average test error and increase prediction accuracy.
